    <p>Why is the world so slow to fight climate change?</br>
    Lots of reasons, of course.</br>
    But let's focus on three.</br>
    Three major assumptions we make about energy, climate and the economy.</br>
    First: that you cannot grow the economy while reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</br>
    Second: that energy systems change only slowly.</br>
    Third: that expensive energy will hurt the economy and jobs.</br>
    It's hard to be optimistic about fighting climate change if you believe these things.</br>
    Are these assumptions true?</br>
    <a name = 'GDPTPESCO2'></a>
    What if they are not?</p>
    
    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <hr><h2>Can we grow the economy and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</h2><hr>

    <p>
    We need energy to survive.</br>
    We need energy to power our factories and our offices and our homes.</br>
    We need energy to move people and goods around.</br>
    Modern life is inconceivable without modern energy.</br>
    But what, exactly, is the relationship between incomes and energy consumption?</br> 
    Richer countries use more energy.</br> 
    But the relationship is neither steady nor linear.</br>
    Countries at similar income levels have vastly different CO<sub>2</sub> footprints.</br>
    Take Switzerland and Qatar. Similar incomes (~$75k per capita), but Qatar emits almost 8x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Switzerland.</br>
    Or Portugal and Bahrain. Similar incomes (~$22k per capita), but Bahrain emits almost 4x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Portugal.</br>
    Or Panama and Curacao. Similar incomes (~$10-12k per capita), but Curacao emits 11x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Panama.</br>
    Or Switzerland and Portugal. Switzerland emits 12% more CO<sub>2</sub>, but its income is 3.5x higher.</br>
    Or Trinidad and Tobago and Luxembourg. Similar CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (~16 tons per capita) but incomes are 6.4x higher in Luxembourg.</br>
    Income does not predict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

    <h3>Incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: Digging deeper</h3>

    <p>
    Why not?</br>
    First, countries use different amounts of energy.</br>
    Their economies may be different. One might rely on heavy industry, another on services.</br>
    Their climate may be different. Cold countries use energy for heat; warmer use it for AC.</br>
    Their energy prices may be different. Some produce energy, others import it. Some tax energy, others subsidize it.</br>
    Their capital may be different. Machines may be newer or buildings older.</br>
    Their policies may be different. Government may have energy efficiency mandates.</br>
    All these differences affect energy consumption.</br>
    Take Malta and Bahrain. Similar incomes (~$20k per capita), but Bahrain consumes 5x more energy per capita as Malta.</br>
    Or Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. Similar incomes ($14-16K per capita), but Trinidad consumes 9x more energy per capita than Uruguay.</br> 
    Income, again, is a poor predictor of energy consumption.</br>

    <p>Second, countries generate their energy in different ways.</br> 
    Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas emit more CO<sub>2</sub> than hydro, nuclear power, wind or solar.</br>
    Qatar and Iceland have similar energy consumption (20 toe vs 18 toe per capita), but CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 5x higher in Qatar.</br>
    Qatar uses oil and gas; Iceland uses hydro and geothermal energy.</br>
    Australia consumes slightly (7%) more energy per capita than Sweden, but its emissions are over 4x higher.</br>
    Germany's emissions are 2x higher than France's, even though they consume similar amounts of energy.</br>
    Not even energy consumption, on its own, predicts CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</br>
    </p>

    <!-- NEW SUB-SECTION -->
    <h3>Incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: Trends over time</h3>

    <p>So far, we have looked only at 2014 data.</br>
    Maybe countries end up at different places.</br>
    But can an economy grow without more energy? Or more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</br>
    The evidence is clear: yes.</br>
    But it is not a given.</br>
    There are many different paths.</br>
    Pattern #1 (Turkey): GDP, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are closely linked. Not perfectly overlapping, but close.</br> 
    Pattern #2 (Australia): Income at some point delinks from energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</br>
    Pattern #3 (Russia): GDP grows but energy use and emissions do not, largely because efficiency gains persist.</br> 
    Pattern #4 (Germany): CO<sub>2</sub> emissions fall faster than energy use; usually because countries relied more on gas or nuclear power.</br>
    Pattern #5 (United Kingdom): No clear link between GDP, energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: incomes grow faster than energy or emissions</br>
    Pattern #6 (China): Income, energy use and emissions grow, but not in tandem: incomes are up 10x in China (vs 1990), energy use 3x, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 4x.</br>
    Pattern #7 (Iran): Energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions growing faster than incomes; energy-dependent growth models that do not deliver commensurate growth.</br>
    Pattern #8 (Bangladesh): Growth in CO<sub>2</sub> outpaces energy use or incomes, as countries replace traditonal (e.g. biomass) for fossil fuels.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>GDP, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h3>

    <p>
    In sum: there is no reason to think that economic growth equals more energy consumption.</br>
    Or that more energy consumption must equal more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</br>
    We have so many different trajectories around the world and throughout history.</br>
    </p>
    
    <!-- NEW SUB-SECTION -->
    <h3>The big picture: Living standards up; emissions less so</h3> 

    <p>
    Let's step back and look at the big picture.</br> 
    Most countries continue to grow: in 101 countries, real GDP per capita was either at its highest level or just below its peak (peak occurred in 2008-2013).</br> 
    These are the countries shown in blue.</br>
    There are also a few countries where per capita GDP peaked before 1990.</br>
    That's because of war, revolution or economic stagnation, the last often linked to mismanagement of natural resources. </br>
    Finally, there are countries where per capita incomes have stagnated, peaking after 1990 but before 2007 (21 countries), many of them in Europe.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>Year of peak GDP per capita</h3>
        <div class = 'graphic' id = 'mapGDPCAPITA'>
            <script src='js/maps.js'></script>
        </div>
        <div class = 'graphLegend'>
            <ul>
                <li style='color: #d7191c'>Before 1990</li>
                <li style='color: #fdae61'>From 1990 to 1999</li>
                <li style='color: #ffffbf'>From 2000 to 2007</li>
                <li style='color: #abd9e9'>From 2008 to 2013</li>
                <li style='color: #2c7bb6'>Highest was 2014</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    <p class = 'graphFootnote'>Source: International Energy Agency, CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2016 Edition)</p>
    

    <p>Per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions show a dramatically different pattern.</br>
    In 30 countries, they peaked before 1990. This is in Europe, North America and parts of Africa (largely due to war).</br>
    In the Former Soviet Union, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been declining since 1990, often at rapid rates.</br>
    Per capita emissions are rising mostly in Asia and Latin America, as well as parts of Africa (36 countries in total). </br>
    In all other places, emissions peaked either recently (25 countries in 2008-2013), or a long time ago.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>Year of peak CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita</h3>
        <div class = 'graphic' id = 'mapCO2CAPITA'>
            <script src='js/maps.js'></script>

        </div>
    <p class = 'graphFootnote'>Source: International Energy Agency, CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2016 Edition)</p>
    
    <p>What does all this mean?</br>
    We know that the link between incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is far from linear.</br> 
    We have so many countries that have grown without using more energy and/or emitting more CO<sub>2</sub>.</br>
    Not all countries are equal, of course: the growth in China and India can overwhelm what happens in many other countries.</br> 
    <a name = 'Transitions'></a>
    Yet the broad picture is clear: so many countries where GDP per capita is growing while emissions are not.</br>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <hr><h2>Can we change our energy systems quickly?</h2><hr>

    <p>The next major assumption we make is about change.</br>
    The consensus is that energy systems change only slowly.</br> 
    It will decades to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</br>
    Why take on costly action today if the results won't show for a long time?</br>
    As in: after politicians are no longer in power or CEOs no longer in office.</br>
    The logic is compelling.</br>
    What does the evidence say?</br>
    In the grand scheme of things, the energy system changes slowly.</br>
    Nuclear power, for example, started to pick up in the late 1960s; by the mid 1990s, it only provided ~6% of the world's energy.</br>
    That's a steep penetration curve.</br>
    But look at smaller groupings, and a different image emerges.</br>
    Yes, there is broad stability: oil's market share in Africa and coal's market share in the Asia Pacific is broadly flat over 50 years.</br>
    But elsewhere, we see major changes. The Middle East used very little gas in the mid 1960s. Now it's more important than oil.</br>
    In Central and South America, hydro went from 10% in 1970 to 25% in 1990.</br> 
    In Europe and Eurasia, gas started from a similar point in 1970 and exceeded 33% in 2005.</br>
    We don't necessarily observe dramatic change.</br>
    But it is also not true that energy systems cannot change.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>Energy consumption by fuel (as % of total energy)</h3>

    <p>Now let us move to countries. Start from the world's 10 largest energy consumers (in 2015).</br>
    Once again, we see relative stability; but there are more pronounced shifts now.</br>
    In Brazil, oil went from 70% in 1973 to 50% in 1985. That's a major shift.</br>
    In Canada, oil went from 45% in 1973 to 30% in 1985.</br>
    In China, coal has thrice lost market: from 87% in 1965 to 70% in 1976; from 77% in 1991 to 70% in 2000; and from 73% in 2005 to 64% in 2015.</br>
    But China also shows that these relative declines need not last. They can be reversed.</br>
    Other countries show similar sharp changes: Japan, Korea, Iran.</br>
    Even the United States, which is a bigger market, has seen coal lose market share quickly: from 24% in 2008 to 17% in 2015.</br> 
    </p>

    <h3>Energy consumption by fuel (as % of total energy)</h3>
        <div class = 'graphic' id = 'fuelMixTop10'></div>
        <div class = 'graphLegend'>
            <ul>
                <li style='color: #636363'>Coal</li>

        </div>
    <p class = 'graphFootnote'>Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy (June 2016)</p>

    <p>Such shifts are even more pronounced in smaller energy markets.</br>
    Let's look at the next 10 largest energy users, which, again, includes a mix of emerging and established economies.</br>
    Here, too, we see some profound shifts in energy consumption.</br>
    Saudi Arabia went from a purely oil-based energy market to one that utilized (previously flared) natural gas.</br>
    France scaled up nuclear power after the 1973 oil shock: by 1990, France got a third of its energy from nuclear, versus 2% in 1973.</br>
    Indonesia started to use more natural gas, and more recently, more coal to reduce its reliance on oil.</br>
    Mexico turned to natural gas: from 26% of its total energy in 2000, gas provided 40% in 2015.</br>
    We see similar shifts in every other major country.</br>
    In fact, significant change is the norm rather than the exception.</br>
    </p>

    <h3>Energy consumption by fuel (as % of total energy)</h3>
        <div class = 'graphic' id = 'fuelMixTop1120'></div>

    <p>In fact, the big picture is clear: countries have routinely being able to change their reliance on a major fuel by 20 percentage points over 10 years.</br>
    Often, they have done a lot more.</br> 
    How did they do it?</br>
    In most cases, they replaced either oil or coal in stationary (non-transport) uses with other fuels.</br> 
    Only rarely have other fuels being the ones displaced.</br>
    Usually, these changes were either a resonse to a shock (e.g. the 1973 oil shock).</br>
    Or they came as a government pushed to use a new (usually domestic) resource such as hydro or natural gas.</br>
    Still: are these changes big enough to matter?</br>
    If one looks at what it takes to arrest climate change, the answer is yes.</br>
    The International Energy Agency outlines a scenario to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gasses at 450 ppm (parts per million).</br>
    This is the scenario that would prevent temperature increases above 2<sup>o</sup>C.</br>
    In that scenario, the market share of oil should decline by 9 percentage points by 2040; and coal's should decline by 13 percentage points.</br>
    In short: two fuels should lose 22 percentage points market share in 27 years time frame (combined with lower overall energy demand growth, of course).</br>
    From a country-level perspective, that's hardly unprecedented.</br>
    Combined with the idea that we can grow an economy without using significantly more energy, we have a strong case for change.</br>
    <a name = 'EnergyCosts'></a>
    The next question, of course, is cost: will a transition to a new energy system hurt consumers and cost jobs?</br>
    </p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <hr><h2>Can we afford more expensive energy?</h2><hr>
    
    <p>Energy prices are very serious business.</br>
    Daily, pundits will opine on what is happening to oil prices.</br>
    Few numbers seem to matter more for the American and world economy.</br>
    In part, this is a legacy from the 1970s.</br>
    According to the conventional wisdom, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s halted America's post-war growth miracle.</br>
    A miracle that was supposedly fueled by cheap energy.</br>
    Yet this pressumed link between energy prices and economic activity has always been suspect.</br>
    
    <!-- NEW SUB-SECTION -->
    <h3>Energy and household spending</h3> 
    <p>In reality, energy costs are a minor part of total consumer spending.</br>
    On average, American consumers have spent 5.7% of their disposable income on energy since 1929, with typical range of 4% to 7%.</br>
    In fact, when oil prices spiked in 2008, households spent less on energy than they did in the 1950s and 1960s when energy was "cheap."</br> 
    The whole "post-war, cheap energy" story looks really questionable when one examines the data closely.</br>

    <h3>US: Personal consumption expenditures (as % of total)</h3>

    <p>To put energy spending in context, consider the following.</br> 
    In 2015, households spent as much on gambling and tobacco as they did to power, heat and cool their homes ($235 billion vs. $246 billion).</br>
    Sending on gasoline and lubricants was equal to spending on telecom services and internet access ($283 billion vs. $268 billion).</br>
    Spending on energy-heavy services was also small: $103 billion in 2015 for public transportation by land, air and sea.</br>
    That's about as much as they spent on pets and pet products ($99 billion).</br>
    No serious economist would go on TV to discuss the macroeconomic consequences of cellphone bills or cigarettes or slot machines or pet grooming.</br>
    But when the experts pontificate about oil or gas prices, everyone listens intently as if these really matter.</br>
    Of course, these numbers are low in part because energy prices have fallen.</br>
    Households spent about $100 billion less on energy in 2015 relative to 2013.</br>
    But remember: consumers spent over $12 trillion dollars in 2015.</br>
    Between 2013 and 2015, their overall spending rose by over $900 billion; spending on health care alone rose $200 billion.</br>
    So the drop in energy prices is welcome—who doesn't want an additional $100 billion?</br>
    But the net effect is trivial in the grand scheme of things.</br> 
    That is why economists can never find a "stimulus" from cheaper oil.</br>
    It doesn't exist: energy is just a small fraction of total household spending.</br>

    <h3>Energy costs for business</h3> 

    <p>
    The picture is similar when it comes to energy costs for businesses.</br> 
    In 2015, private businesses spent $484 billion on energy.</br> 
    That's about 2.4% of the $20 trillion they spent on all costs (energy, materials, services, and labor).</br> 
    Here too, costs have fallen in line with prices but the stimulus is small—$260 billion since 2008, or about two percentage points of total costs.</br> 
    For manufacturing industries, energy costs are even lower: 1.5% of all costs, relative to a peak of 2.7% in 2008 when oil prices were at all-time highs.</br> 
    Of course, for some industries, energy matters more, but rarely does it rise above 10%.</br>
    No wonder, then, that the expected "manufacturing renaissance" based on cheap energy never materialized.</br> 
    In fact, energy-intensive industries have performed poorly despite the supposed competitive advantage conferred to American firms by cheaper energy.</br>
    Oddly enough, many energy-intensive manufacturing sectors are still below their pre-crisis levels.</br> 
    By contrast, industries with low energy-intensity are doing better.</br>
    These results are hardly surprising. When the European Commission investigated the effects of energy costs on competitiveness, it found no impact.</br>
    In fact, there is little geographical overlap between cheap energy (e.g. the former Soviet Union, the Middle East) and advanced manufacturing (e.g. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Germany).</br> 
    Even for simpler manufacturing, labor and other factors matter much more than energy costs.</br>
    Nor is there even a clear link between industrial production and industrial energy consumption.</br>
    In the United States, industrial energy consumption is roughly at the same level as in 1973, while industrial production has doubled.</br>
    In Japan, industrial production is up 67% but energy consumption in industry is down 16%.</br>
    In the United Kingdom, production is up 32% while energy use is down 64%; and so on.</br>
    The one sector where energy matters is transportation.</br> 
    In transportation, energy costs are much higher—as much as 36% of all costs (airlines in 2008), but typically around 10% to 30%.</br>
    Expensive energy can harm these industries—and, since they transport goods and people around, their performance affects everyone.</br>
    But it is not clear that more expensive energy has been that impactful.</br>
    If one measures corporate profits, transportation is all but struggling.</br>
    After the 9-11 shock, which really hit airlines, profits in the transportation industry have been booming.</br>
    In every year between 2005 and 2015, transportation generated more annual profits, in real terms, that at any year since 1948.</br>
    Employment shows a more mixed picture: it reached an all-time high in 2007, it fell as the economy slowed down and then jumped again in 2015.</br>
    But high energy prices also created new demand for transportation services—especially for railroads.</br>
    What about transportation costs and their impact on the economy?</br>
    Here too, we need to put numbers in context.</br> 
    It takes less than four cents to move a dollar of output on average.</br>
    Only one industry, wholesale and retail trade, spends much above that (10 cents for every dollar).</br>
    More importantly, the link between energy prices and transportation costs is not linear.</br>
    Between January 2004 and July 2008, oil prices roughly tripled, but transport costs rose by 47% for rail, and around 30% for air, water and road (truck) transport.</br>
    And these industries made other adjustments too: airlines, for instance, became more efficient—planes were over 84% full in 2014 versus 71% in 2000.</br>
    More importantly, it takes less and less energy to transport goods and people.</br>
    Fuel economy for all motor vehicles in the United States rose by 40% from 1973 and 1993, but then stalled as corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards were left unchanged.</br>
    Domestic airlines used 77% less energy per passenger mile in 2014 than they did in 1970.</br>
    Railroads used 55% less energy to transport freight in the same period.</br>
    <a name = 'Conclusion'></a>
    These long-term gains have helped mute the impact of energy costs on businesses.</br>

    <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>

    <p>
    The biggest obstacle to fighting climate change is some outdated ideas about energy.</br>
    That we can only save the environment by compromising economic growth.</br>
    That energy systems change slowly and our our actions will saddle us with costs but no benefits.</br>
    That if governments do anything that raises energy prices, they will severely harm consumers, cost jobs and shift industries overseas.</br> 
    If we can dispel those myths, we can accelerate our transition to low-carbon energy.</br> 
    Of course, this transition will not be easy or painless.</br>
    There are millions of people who depend, directly or indirectly, on jobs generated by fossil fuels.</br>
    Plenty of capital is deployed to these sectors as well.</br>
    A transition to a low-carbon economy needs to include a strategy for both people and capital, as well as measures to protect vulnerable households if energy prices do rise.</br>
    But this just means the strategy needs to be comprehensive and inclusive—not that we shouldn't try.</br>
    In fact, we know that action can yield results quickly: we have plenty of examples where countries have made big changes to their energy systems in fifteen to twenty years.</br>
    The only barrier is a series of myths about energy and economics.</br> 
    <a name = 'Appendix'></a>
    Dispel these, and we can forge a new consensus to save the planet.</br>
