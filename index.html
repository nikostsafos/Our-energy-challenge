    <p>Why is the world so slow to fight climate change?</p>

    <p>Lots of reasons, of course.</p>

    <p>But let's focus on three.</p>

    <p>Three major assumptions we make about energy, climate and the economy.</p>

    <p>First: that you cannot grow the economy while reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

    <p>Second: that energy systems change only slowly.</p>

    <p>Third: that expensive energy will hurt the economy and jobs.</p>

    <p>It's hard to be optimistic about fighting climate change if you believe these things.</p> 

    <p>Are these assumptions true?</p>

    <a name = 'GDPTPESCO2'></a>
    <p>What if they are not?</p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <hr><h2>Can we grow the economy and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</h2><hr>

    <p>We need energy in order to survive. And we need energy to power our economies.</p>

    <p>This fact is so fixed in our thinking.</p> 

    <p>This is the first assumption we make: that energy and grow go together.</p>

    <p>What follows is this: if we want to curb CO2 emissions, we might need to sacrifice growth.</p>

    <p>That's a political non-starter.</p>

    <p>What does the evidence say?</p>

    <p>Richer countries use more energy, and thus, emit more CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

    <p>But the relationship is neither steady nor linear.</p>

    <p>Countries at similar income levels have vastly different CO<sub>2</sub> footprints.</p>

    <p>Take Switzerland and Qatar. Similar incomes (~$75k per capita), but Qatar emits almost 8x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Switzerland.</p>

    <p>Or Portugal and Bahrain. Similar incomes (~$22k per capita), but Bahrain emits almost 4x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Portugal.</p>

    <p>Or Panama and Curacao. Similar incomes (~$10-12k per capita), but Curacao emits 11x more CO<sub>2</sub> per capita than Panama.</p>

    <p>Or Switzerland and Portugal. Switzerland emits 12% more CO<sub>2</sub>, but its income is 3.5x higher.</p>

    <p>Or Trinidad and Tobago and Luxembourg. Similar CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (~16 tons per capita) but incomes are 6.4x higher in Luxembourg.</p>

    <p>Income does not predict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

    <h3>Incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: Digging deeper</h3>

    <p>Why not?</p>

    <p>First, countries use different amounts of energy.</p>

    <p>Their economies may be different. One might rely on heavy industry, another on services.</p>

    <p>Their climate may be different. Cold countries use energy for heat; warmer use it for AC.</p>

    <p>Their energy prices may be different. Some produce energy, others import it. Some tax energy, others subsidize it.</p>

    <p>Their capital may be different. Machines may be newer or buildings older.</p>

    <p>Their policies may be different. Government may have energy efficiency mandates.</p>

    <p>All these differences affect energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Take Malta and Bahrain. Similar incomes (~$20k per capita), but Bahrain consumes 5x more energy per capita as Malta.</p>

    <p>Or Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. Similar incomes ($14-16K per capita), but Trinidad consumes 9x more energy per capita than Uruguay.</p> 

    <p>Income, again, is a poor predictor of energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Second, countries generate their energy in different ways.</p> 

    <p>Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas emit more CO<sub>2</sub> than hydro, nuclear power, wind or solar.</p>

    <p>Qatar and Iceland have similar energy consumption (20 toe vs 18 toe per capita), but CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 5x higher in Qatar.</p>

    <p>Qatar uses oil and gas; Iceland uses hydro and geothermal energy.</p>

    <p>Australia consumes slightly (7%) more energy per capita than Sweden, but its emissions are over 4x higher.</p>

    <p>Germany's emissions are 2x higher than France's, even though they consume similar amounts of energy.</p>

    <p>Not even energy consumption, on its own, predicts CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <h3>Incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: Trends over time</h3>

    <p>So far, we have looked only at 2014 data.</p>

    <p>Maybe countries end up at different places.</p>

    <p>But can an economy grow without more energy? Or more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</p>

    <p>The evidence is clear: yes.</p>

    <p>But it is not a given.</p>

    <p>There are so many different patterns.</p>

    <p>Pattern #1 (Turkey): GDP, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are closely linked. Not perfectly overlapping, but close.</p> 

    <p>Pattern #2 (Australia): Income at some point delinks from energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

    <p>Pattern #3 (Russia): GDP grows but energy use and emissions do not, largely because efficiency gains persist.</p> 

    <p>Pattern #4 (Germany): CO<sub>2</sub> emissions fall faster than energy use; usually because countries relied more on gas or nuclear power.</p>

    <p>Pattern #5 (United Kingdom): No clear link between GDP, energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: incomes grow faster than energy or emissions</p>

    <p>Pattern #6 (China): Income, energy use and emissions grow, but not in tandem: incomes are up 10x in China (vs 1990), energy use 3x, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 4x.</p>

    <p>Pattern #7 (Iran): Energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions growing faster than incomes; energy-dependent growth models that do not deliver commensurate growth.</p>

    <p>Pattern #8 (Bangladesh): Growth in CO<sub>2</sub> outpaces energy use or incomes, as countries replace traditonal (e.g. biomass) for fossil fuels.</p>

    <p>In sum: there is no reason to think that economic growth equals more energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Or that more energy consumption must equal more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

    <p>We have so many different trajectories around the world and throughout history.</p>

    <p>(The <a href='appendixone.html' target= '_blank'>appendix</a> shows GDP, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 133 countries).</p>

	<!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <h3>The big picture: Living standards up; emissions less so</h3> 

    <p>Let's step back and look at the big picture.</p> 

    <p>Most countries continue to grow: in 101 countries, real GDP per capita was either at its highest level or just below its peak (peak occurred in 2008-2013).</p> 

    <p>These are the countries shown in blue.</p>

    <p>There are also a few countries where per capita GDP peaked before 1990.</p>

    <p>That's because of war, revolution or economic stagnation, the last often linked to mismanagement of natural resources. </p>

    <p>Finally, there are countries where per capita incomes have stagnated, peaking after 1990 but before 2007 (21 countries), many of them in Europe.</p>

    <p>Per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions show a dramatically different pattern.</p>

    <p>In 30 countries, they peaked before 1990. This is in Europe, North America and parts of Africa (largely due to war).</p>

    <p>In the Former Soviet Union, energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been declining since 1990, often at rapid rates.</p>

    <p>Per capita emissions are rising mostly in Asia and Latin America, as well as parts of Africa (36 countries in total). </p>

    <p>In all other places, emissions peaked either recently (25 countries in 2008-2013), or a long time ago.</p>

    <p>What does all this mean?</p>

    <p>We know that the link between incomes and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is far from linear.</p> 

    <p>We have so many countries that have grown without using more energy and/or emitting more CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

    <p>Not all countries are equal, of course: the growth in China and India can overwhelm what happens in many other countries.</p> 

    <a name = 'Transitions'></a>
    <p>Yet the broad picture is clear: so many countries where GDP per capita is growing while CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not.</p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    <hr><h2>Can we change our energy systems quickly?</h2><hr>

    <p>The next major assumption we make is about change.</p>

    <p>The consensus is that energy systems change only slowly.</p> 

    <p>It will decades to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</p>

    <p>Why take on costly action today if the results won't show for a long time?</p>

    <p>As in: after politicians are no longer in power or CEOs no longer in office.</p>

    <p>The logic is compelling.</p>

    <p>What does the evidence say?</p>

    <p>In the grand scheme of things, the energy system changes slowly.</p>

    <p>Nuclear power, for example, started to pick up in the late 1960s; by the mid 1990s, it only provided ~6% of the world's energy.</p>

    <p>That's a steep penetration curve.</p>

    <p>But look at smaller groupings, and a different image emerges.</p>

    <p>Yes, there is broad stability: oil's market share in Africa and coal's market share in the Asia Pacific is broadly flat over 50 years.</p>

    <p>But elsewhere, we see major changes. The Middle East used very little gas in the mid 1960s. Now it's more important than oil.</p>

    <p>In Central and South America, hydro went from 10% in 1970 to 25% in 1990.</p> 

    <p>In Europe and Eurasia, gas started from a similar point in 1970 and exceeded 33% in 2005.</p>

    <p>We don't necessarily observe dramatic change.</p>

    <p>But it is also not true that energy systems cannot change.</p>

    <p>Now let us move to countries. Start from the world's 10 largest energy consumers (in 2015).</p>

    <p>Once again, we see relative stability; but there are more pronounced shifts now.</p>

    <p>In Brazil, oil went from 70% in 1973 to 50% in 1985. That's a major shift.</p>

    <p>In Canada, oil went from 45% in 1973 to 30% in 1985.</p>

    <p>In China, coal has thrice lost market: from 87% in 1965 to 70% in 1976; from 77% in 1991 to 70% in 2000; and from 73% in 2005 to 64% in 2015.</p>

    <p>But China also shows that these relative declines need not last. They can be reversed.</p>

    <p>Other countries show similar sharp changes: Japan, Korea, Iran.</p>

    <p>Even the United States, which is a bigger market, has seen coal lose market share quickly: from 24% in 2008 to 17% in 2015.</p>

    <p>Such shifts are even more pronounced in smaller energy markets.</p>

    <p>Let's look at the next 10 largest energy users, which, again, includes a mix of emerging and established economies.</p>

    <p>Here, too, we see some profound shifts in energy consumption.</p>

    <p>Saudi Arabia went from a purely oil-based energy market to one that utilized (previously flared) natural gas.</p>

    <p>France scaled up nuclear power after the 1973 oil shock: by 1990, France got a third of its energy from nuclear, versus 2% in 1973.</p>

    <p>Indonesia started to use more natural gas, and more recently, more coal to reduce its reliance on oil.</p>

    <p>Mexico turned to natural gas: from 26% of its total energy in 2000, gas provided 40% in 2015.</p>

    <p>We see similar shifts in every other major country.</p>

    <p>In fact, significant change is the norm rather than the exception.</p>

    <p>In fact, the big picture is clear: countries have routinely being able to change their reliance on a major fuel by 20 percentage points over 10 years.</p>

    <p>Often, they have done a lot more.</p> 

    <p>How did they do it?</p>

    <p>In most cases, they replaced either oil or coal in stationary (non-transport) uses with other fuels.</p> 

    <p>Only rarely have other fuels being the ones displaced.</p>

    <p>Usually, these changes were either a resonse to a shock (e.g. the 1973 oil shock).</p>

    <p>Or they came as a government pushed to use a new (usually domestic) resource such as hydro or natural gas.</p>

    <p>Still: are these changes big enough to matter?</p>

    <p>If one looks at what it takes to arrest climate change, the answer is yes.</p>

    <p>The International Energy Agency outlines a scenario to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gasses at 450 ppm (parts per million).</p>

    <p>This is the scenario that would prevent temperature increases above 2<sup>o</sup>C.</p>

    <p>In that scenario, the market share of oil should decline by 9 percentage points by 2040; and coal's should decline by 13 percentage points.</p>

    <p>In short: two fuels should lose 22 percentage points market share in 27 years time frame (combined with lower overall energy demand growth, of course).</p>

    <p>From a country-level perspective, that's hardly unprecedented.</p>

    <p>Combined with the idea that we can grow an economy without using significantly more energy, we have a strong case for change.</p>

    <a name = 'EnergyCosts'></a>
    <p>The next question, of course, is cost: will a transition to a new energy system hurt consumers and cost jobs?</p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->
    
    <hr><h2>Can we afford more expensive energy?</h2><hr>

    <p>Energy prices are very serious business.</p>

    <p>Daily, pundits will opine on what is happening to oil prices.</p>
    
    <p>Few numbers seem to matter more for the American and world economy.</p>

    <p>In part, this is a legacy from the 1970s.</p>

    <p>According to the conventional wisdom, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s halted America's post-war growth miracle.</p>

    <p>A miracle that was supposedly fueled by cheap energy.</p>

    <p>Yet this pressumed link between energy prices and economic activity has always been suspect.</p>

    <h3>Energy and household spending</h3> 

    <p>In reality, energy costs are a minor part of total consumer spending.</p>

    <p>On average, American consumers have spent 5.7% of their disposable income on energy since 1929, with typical range of 4% to 7%.</p>

    <p>In fact, when oil prices spiked in 2008, households spent less on energy than they did in the 1950s and 1960s when energy was "cheap."</p> 

    <p>The whole "post-war, cheap energy" story looks really questionable when one examines the data closely.</p>

    <p>To put energy spending in context, consider the following.</p> 

    <p>In 2015, households spent as much on gambling and tobacco as they did to power, heat and cool their homes ($235 billion vs. $246 billion).</p>

    <p>Sending on gasoline and lubricants was equal to spending on telecom services and internet access ($283 billion vs. $268 billion).</p>

    <p>Spending on energy-heavy services was also small: $103 billion in 2015 for public transportation by land, air and sea.</p>

    <p>That's about as much as they spent on pets and pet products ($99 billion).</p>

    <p>No serious economist would go on TV to discuss the macroeconomic consequences of cellphone bills or cigarettes or slot machines or pet grooming.</p>

    <p>But when the experts pontificate about oil or gas prices, everyone listens intently as if these really matter.</p>

    <p>Of course, these numbers are low in part because energy prices have fallen.</p>

    <p>Households spent about $100 billion less on energy in 2015 relative to 2013.</p>

    <p>But remember: consumers spent over $12 trillion dollars in 2015.</p>

    <p>Between 2013 and 2015, their overall spending rose by over $900 billion; spending on health care alone rose $200 billion.</p>

    <p>So the drop in energy prices is welcome—who doesn't want an additional $100 billion?</p>

    <p>But the net effect is trivial in the grand scheme of things.</p> 

    <p>That is why economists can never find a "stimulus" from cheaper oil.</p>

    <p>It doesn't exist: energy is just a small fraction of total household spending.</p>

    <h3>Energy costs for business</h3> 

    <p>The picture is similar when it comes to energy costs for businesses.</p> 

    <p>In 2015, private businesses spent $484 billion on energy.</p> 

    <p>That's about 2.4% of the $20 trillion they spent on all costs (energy, materials, services, and labor).</p> 

    <p>Here too, costs have fallen in line with prices but the stimulus is small—$260 billion since 2008, or about two percentage points of total costs.</p> 

    <p>For manufacturing industries, energy costs are even lower: 1.5% of all costs, relative to a peak of 2.7% in 2008 when oil prices were at all-time highs.</p> 

    <p>Of course, for some industries, energy matters more, but rarely does it rise above 10%.</p>

    <p>No wonder, then, that the expected "manufacturing renaissance" based on cheap energy never materialized.</p> 

    <p>In fact, energy-intensive industries have performed poorly despite the supposed competitive advantage conferred to American firms by cheaper energy.</p>

    <p>Oddly enough, many energy-intensive manufacturing sectors are still below their pre-crisis levels.</p> 

    <p>By contrast, industries with low energy-intensity are doing better.</p>

    <p>These results are hardly surprising. When the European Commission investigated the effects of energy costs on competitiveness, it found no impact.</p>

    <p>In fact, there is little geographical overlap between cheap energy (e.g. the former Soviet Union, the Middle East) and advanced manufacturing (e.g. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Germany).</p> 

    <p>Even for simpler manufacturing, labor and other factors matter much more than energy costs.</p>

    <p>Nor is there even a clear link between industrial production and industrial energy consumption.</p>

    <p>In the United States, industrial energy consumption is roughly at the same level as in 1973, while industrial production has doubled.</p>

    <p>In Japan, industrial production is up 67% but energy consumption in industry is down 16%.</p>

    <p>In the United Kingdom, production is up 32% while energy use is down 64%; and so on.</p>

    <p>The one sector where energy matters is transportation.</p> 

    <p>In transportation, energy costs are much higher—as much as 36% of all costs (airlines in 2008), but typically around 10% to 30%.</p>

    <p>Expensive energy can harm these industries—and, since they transport goods and people around, their performance affects everyone.</p>

    <p>But it is not clear that more expensive energy has been that impactful.</p>

    <p>If one measures corporate profits, transportation is all but struggling.</p>

    <p>After the 9-11 shock, which really hit airlines, profits in the transportation industry have been booming.</p>

    <p>In every year between 2005 and 2015, transportation generated more annual profits, in real terms, that at any year since 1948.</p>

    <p>Employment shows a more mixed picture: it reached an all-time high in 2007, it fell as the economy slowed down and then jumped again in 2015.</p>

    <p>But high energy prices also created new demand for transportation services—especially for railroads.</p>

    <p>What about transportation costs and their impact on the economy?</p>

    <p>Here too, we need to put numbers in context.</p> 

    <p>It takes less than four cents to move a dollar of output on average.</p>

    <p>Only one industry, wholesale and retail trade, spends much above that (10 cents for every dollar).</p>

    <p>More importantly, the link between energy prices and transportation costs is not linear.</p>

    <p>Between January 2004 and July 2008, oil prices roughly tripled, but transport costs rose by 47% for rail, and around 30% for air, water and road (truck) transport.</p>

    <p>And these industries made other adjustments too: airlines, for instance, became more efficient—planes were over 84% full in 2014 versus 71% in 2000.</p>

    <p>More importantly, it takes less and less energy to transport goods and people.</p>

    <p>Fuel economy for all motor vehicles in the United States rose by 40% from 1973 and 1993, but then stalled as corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards were left unchanged.</p>

    <p>Domestic airlines used 77% less energy per passenger mile in 2014 than they did in 1970.</p>

    <p>Railroads used 55% less energy to transport freight in the same period.</p>

    <a name = 'Conclusion'></a>
    <p>These long-term gains have helped mute the impact of energy costs on businesses.</p>

    <!-- NEW SECTION -->    
    <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>

    <p>The biggest obstacle to fighting climate change is some outdated ideas about energy.</p>

    <p>That we can only save the environment by compromising economic growth.</p>

    <p>That energy systems change slowly and our our actions will saddle us with costs but no benefits.</p>

    <p>That if governments do anything that raises energy prices, they will severely harm consumers, cost jobs and shift industries overseas.</p> 

    <p>If we can dispel those myths, we can accelerate our transition to low-carbon energy.</p> 

    <p>Of course, this transition will not be easy or painless.</p>

    <p>There are millions of people who depend, directly or indirectly, on jobs generated by fossil fuels.</p>

    <p>Plenty of capital is deployed to these sectors as well.</p>

    <p>A transition to a low-carbon economy needs to include a strategy for both people and capital, as well as measures to protect vulnerable households if energy prices do rise.</p>

    <p>But this just means the strategy needs to be comprehensive and inclusive—not that we shouldn't try.</p>

    <p>In fact, we know that action can yield results quickly: we have plenty of examples where countries have made big changes to their energy systems in fifteen to twenty years.</p>
    
    <p>The only barrier is a series of myths about energy and economics.</p> 

    <p>Dispel these, and we can forge a new consensus to save the planet.</p>
