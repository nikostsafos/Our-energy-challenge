    <p>1. OECD includes Estonia and Slovenia starting in 1990. Prior to 1990, data for these two countries are included in Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia.</p>
    <p>2. Note by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to “Cyprus” relates to the southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”. Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey The information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
    <p>3. Serbia includes Kosovo from 1990 to 1999 and Montenegro from 1990 to 2004.</p>
    <p>4. Latvia was not an OECD Member at the time of the preparation of this publication. Accordingly, Latvia does not appear in the list of OECD Members and is still included in the non-OECD aggregate.</p>
    <p>5. The Netherlands Antilles was dissolved on 10 October 2010, resulting in two new constituent countries, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, with the other islands joining the Netherlands. However, due to a lack of detailed data, the IEA secretariat’s data and estimates under the Netherlands Antilles still refer to the whole territory of the Netherlands Antilles as it was known prior to 10 October 2010 up to the end of 2011. Data refer only to the island of Curaçao from 2012. The other islands of the former Netherlands Antilles are added to Other Non-OECD Americas from 2012.</p>
    <p>Note: The countries listed above are those for which the IEA secretariat has direct statistics contacts. This document is without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory, to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory, city or area. In this publication “country” refers to country or territory, as the case may be.</p>
